title: Wow! I am now a GitHub Arctic Code Vault Contributor

[![Erdem KÃ¶se - Arctic Code Vault Contributor](/Users/erdemkose/Documents/Code-Personal/erdemkose.github.io/images/erdemkose-github-arctic-code-vault-contributor.png)](https://github.com/erdemkose)
Today, when I opened [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/erdemkose), I was both happy and sad.

I was happy because I learned that [itsecurityco/to-google-translate](https://github.com/itsecurityco/to-google-translate) project which I have [a small contribution](https://github.com/itsecurityco/to-google-translate/pull/75) will be stored in [GitHub's arctic code vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).
It means that my contribution will be kept for the next thousand years ðŸ¤©

I was sad because if I had contributed more, I could have more code in that arctic code vault.
I hope this helps to motivate me more about open source contribution.
I will start to allocate an amount of time per week for open source projects.
