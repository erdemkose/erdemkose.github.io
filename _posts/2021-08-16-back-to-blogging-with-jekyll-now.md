title: Finally moved to Jekyll with Jekyll Now
---

I have always wanted to move to Jekyll since the first time I saw it. After many years, here I am with my new blog built by [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Jekyll Now is a really great tool to create your blog. Just fork the repository and start blogging.

I know blogging is not as easy as it looks but I will force-push myself to post regularly :)
